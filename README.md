OWatch Stats!

A dynamic website built with jQuery and React for the purpose of providing information about characters from Blizzard's video game Overwatch.

How it works:

Select a role of either "Offense, Defense, Tank, or Support"
A window will animate down displaying all of the heroes in the given role as well as a description of the selected role.

Select "Learn More" button
You will be brought to a new page that is rendered dynamically according to what role you are trying to look at. You can then select a hero to learn more about some of their abilities from the game.
